        <h2>Jacob Kertesz</h2>
        <p>Hello. My name is Jacob Kertesz (spoken like Curtis), and I am from Smoot, Wyoming. 
        It's a nice place to be if you can tolerate the amount of snow the winter drops. 
        I have recntly returned from my mission and am working on a Bachelors in Software and Web Development. </p>
        <p>One intersting thing about me is that I like to come up with worlds and stories that happen in them.
        One day I hope to write them; however, a major obstacle is ironically writing. I write quite slow and 
        find it an unfun, time-consuming process. But, I've stuck with it, and every now and then I write down somee notes.
        The good news is I'm improving, making more consistent progress.
        </p>
