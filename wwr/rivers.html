                <h2>Highlights from the past season</h2>
                <p>
                    What an incredible season we have had. We celebrated our 50th 
                    year of running trips down the Grand Canyon. This year we ran 
                    36 trips down the Grand Canyon introducing over 800 people to 
                    one of our favorite places on earth. We trained 4 new guides 
                    and welcomed them to our family. The season started off with 
                    some chilly weather in the early season, but our guests braved 
                    the cold and loved every minute of their trip (show pictures). 
                    Later the temperatures soared reaching highs of 120 F in the 
                    Grand canyon and 95 on the Salmon. We didn't have any trouble 
                    getting people in the water at those temperatures.

                    <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
                    <p>
                        Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds 
                        the Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago 
                        as the River of No Return by the people living near it because 
                        of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love 
                        with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.

                        Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river 
                        and bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. The river 
                        corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which 
                        tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter 
                        from sun or rain when needed.
                        
                        Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The 
                        Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United 
                        States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, 
                        and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer 
                        in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but 
                        families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the 
                        late summer's slower, warmer water more.

                    <h2>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
                    <p>
                        Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most 
                        desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the 
                        mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, 
                        beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run 
                        famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys 
                        Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding 
                        scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric 
                        and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.

                        Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days

                        Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. 
                        This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history 
                        that the canyon tells.

                    <h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of 
                        all river trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand 
                        Canyon.

                        Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with 
                        breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river 
                        experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating 
                        whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian 
                        ruins accessible only by river.
                        
                        CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. 
                        The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) 
                        to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. 
                        However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river 
                        rating scale, so we often refer to both.
