                <h2>Stinging Nettle:</h2>
                <p>
                    A widespread plant with small stinging hairs on its stems 
                    and leaves. Gives an itching, burning sensation and inflammation when 
                    touched. Their leaves have many serrations at their edge, and the leaves 
                    grow in pairs, one on opposite sides of the stem.
                </p>

                <h2>Lodgepole Pine:</h2>
                <p>
                    A conifer that is not common in most of Wyoming. It can be 
                    found in places such as Yellowstone and of course Star Valley. Strangely, 
                    these trees are fire-dependent species meaning they grow best after a 
                    forest fire. While other tree populations tend to struggle after a fire, 
                    the Lodgepole populations have a net increase because of the fire.

                <h2>Giant Red Indian Paintbrush:</h2>
                <p>
                    A rare wildflower to find in Wyoming but 
                    easily recognizable. They grow a little over 2 feet tall and have green 
                    leaves, purple stems, and red flowers. These plants are parasitic to other 
                    plants and form many connections via their roots. Due to this, they cannot 
                    be transplanted. These plants are also the source of defensive compounds 
                    that some insect larvae can extract and use it as a deterrent for predators.
